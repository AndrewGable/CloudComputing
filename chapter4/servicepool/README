This project demonstrates the use of Restful JAX-RS in
conjunction with HAProxy. 

As a first step download and install HAProxy for your
operating system. Details can be found here:

http://www.haproxy.org/#down

HAProxy supports the following platforms

Linux 2.4 on x86, x86_64, Alpha, Sparc, MIPS, PARISC
Linux 2.6 / 3.x on x86, x86_64, ARM, Sparc, PPC64
Solaris 8/9 on UltraSPARC 2 and 3
Solaris 10 on Opteron and UltraSPARC
FreeBSD 4.10 - 10 on x86
OpenBSD 3.1 to -current on i386, amd64, macppc, alpha, sparc64 and VAX (check the ports)
AIX 5.1 - 5.3 on Powerâ„¢ architecture 

For installation on Mac use instructions at : 
http://nepalonrails.tumblr.com/post/9674428224/setup-haproxy-for-development-environment-on-mac-osx

If you are using windows, install a Virtual machine with one of the above mentioned
operating systems and checkout the git repository on the VM and proceed with the
instructions below.


To build the project use:
	mvn clean test
You need to run two server instances 
one at port 9001 and second at 9002
To run the Servers use the commands:
	mvn exec:java -Dexec.args=9001
	mvn exec:java -Dexec.args=9002
To test the individual services are running use the browser 
to visit 
	http://localhost:9001/myapp/colo
	http://localhost:9002/myapp/colo
At this point you need to start the HAProxy installation
using the config file haproxy.cfg included with this code
package

This will make the service available with the URI
	http://localhost:9000/myapp/colo
Open a new browser and check the response the service
will provide you a response like

	Request was served by : http://localhost:9001/myapp/colo/
	or
	Request was served by : http://localhost:9002/myapp/colo/

depending upon which service has handled the request for the server.

To stress test the system use the following command

	mvn -Ptest
	
this command will run a number of http calls to the server and 
will display the number of responses from each service.

You can also check out the HAProxy dashboard at http://localhost:9100/
