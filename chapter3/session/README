This project demonstrates the use of Restful JAX-RS.
To build the project use:
	mvn clean package
To run the Server use the command:
	mvn exec:java
To test the service use the browser to visit 
	http://localhost:9090/myapp/session/login
When you visit the URI for the first time, server will check if an "userid"
is associated with the server session. If not it will allocate one to your
session.
Refresh the web page within the browser
	http://localhost:9090/myapp/session/login
the server will display your previously allocated id
You can also check using the URI
	http://localhost:9090/myapp/session/id
