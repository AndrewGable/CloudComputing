 NOTES:
 
 For compiling the program, please use maven build system, more information can be found at http://maven.apache.org/
 To incrementally build the project, use:
 	mvn package
 To build the project and recompile all the dependencies:
 	mvn clean package
 	
This project demonstrates the JAX-WS tool known as wsdl2java, this tool allows us to create java files from 
wsdl files. As one can see from the accompanying pom.xml file, the tool is invoked during the process-classes
phase of the build process. As seen in example below, the configuration specifies the wsdl to use during the
invocation of the tool - namely "src/main/resources/Promotions.wsdl"

				<executions>
					<execution>
						<id>generate-sources</id>
						<phase>generate-sources</phase>
						<configuration>
							<sourceRoot>${project.build.directory}/generated/cxf</sourceRoot>
							<wsdlOptions>
								<wsdlOption>
									<wsdl>${basedir}/src/main/resources/Promotions.wsdl</wsdl>
								</wsdlOption>
							</wsdlOptions>
						</configuration>
						<goals>
							<goal>wsdl2java</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
				</executions>
				
to generate the java files, use the command:
	mvn process-classes
this will generate the Ledger.wsdl in the folder $(PROJECT_HOME)/target/generated/cxf/course/cloud/computing/

As a part of the exercise examine the various java files generated from the WSDL. Pay special attention
to the class hierarchy generated by the tool.
