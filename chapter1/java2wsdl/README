 NOTES:
 
 For compiling the program, please use maven build system, more information can be found at http://maven.apache.org/
 To incrementally build the project, use:
 	mvn package
 To build the project and recompile all the dependencies:
 	mvn clean package
 	
This project demonstrates the JAX-WS tool known as java2wsdl, this tool allows us to create WSDL files from 
java files. As one can see from the accompanying pom.xml file, the tool is invoked during the process-classes
phase of the build process. As seen in example below, the configuration specifies the class to use during the
invocation of the tool - namely "course.cloud.computing.Ledger"

				<executions>
					<execution>
						<id>process-classes</id>
						<phase>process-classes</phase>
						<configuration>
							<className>course.cloud.computing.Ledger</className>
							<genWsdl>true</genWsdl>
							<verbose>true</verbose>
						</configuration>
						<goals>
							<goal>java2ws</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
				</executions>
				
to generate the wsdl file, use the command:
	mvn process-classes
this will generate the Ledger.wsdl in the folder $(PROJECT_HOME)/target/generated/wsdl/Ledger.wsdl

As a part of the exercise examine the various sections of the generated WSDL and pay special attention to
exception handling.
