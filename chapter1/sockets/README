 NOTES:
 
 For compiling the program, please use maven build system, more information can be found at http://maven.apache.org/
 To incrementally build the project, use:
 	mvn package
 To build the project and recompile all the dependencies:
 	mvn clean package
 	
This project demonstrates the use of Sockets. The server starts listening at the specified
port and on successful connection from the client, creates two threads a listening thread 
and a sending thread. The sending thread listens to std in and redirects the contents over 
the socket. The receiver thread polls the socket for the incoming messages and then prints
the incoming messages on the console.

The client starts with an attempted connection to the server on the specified hostname and
the port. On successful connection, the client creates two threads a listening thread 
and a sending thread. The sending thread listens to std in and redirects the contents over 
the socket. The receiver thread polls the socket for the incoming messages and then prints
the incoming messages on the console.

The server needs to be started before the client. Open two console windows and in one
start the server using the command:
	mvn -Pserver
and in second you can start the client:
	mvn -Pclient
and now, chat between the two console windows.
